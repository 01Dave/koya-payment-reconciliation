# Payment reconciliation

`payments.jsonl` is an export of payment events from a payments provider, one JSON object per line. The reconciliation script is meant to work out how much money was actually collected, but it doesn't work.

Fix it, in Python (`reconcile.py`) or JavaScript (`reconcile.js`), whichever you prefer. When it's right, it prints a code. Paste that code into the application form.

## How the data works

- Each line is one event: `txn_id`, `status` (`success`, `failed` or `pending`), `amount` in naira, `currency`, and `ts` (when it happened, UTC).
- A payment can be attempted more than once. Every attempt has the same `txn_id`. Only the latest attempt for each `txn_id` counts.
- A payment counts as collected only if its latest attempt is `success`.
- The export comes from a production system and isn't perfectly clean. Ignore lines that can't be read, and events without a `txn_id`. Every other event is valid and must be counted correctly.
- `expected.txt` holds the number of successful payments the finance team counted by hand. The script checks itself against it.

## What to submit
